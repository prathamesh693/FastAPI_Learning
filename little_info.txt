Why choose Python for this project ?
Why choose FastAPI for this project ?
What is uvicorn and why you choose it ?

##########################
we have a code but the server is not running ?
--> Because Python is console based so we have to used web server. i.e. (uvicorn)

how to run the server ?
--> uvicorn main[main_file]:app[object of FastAPI]

not run server multiple time ?
-- > uvicorn main:app --reload
-- the reload it automatically reload the changes in the server without again save & run the server.

What is Rest ?
--> Representational State Tranfer (Rest) when client ask for data server send current state/data as an response

what/ why the end points ?
--> when we develop an website for ecommerce but the client as for job so our server can't do this.
So as a server it has some end points like buy the product, explore the product, payments etc.
so to build this end point we need API's (Application Programming Interface).

CRUD -- Create, Read, Update, Delete
http give methods to perform CRUD operations
-- Get --> Read
-- Post --> Create
-- Put --> Update
-- Delete --> Delete

## pydantic
--> pydantic is basically data validation & also when we want to convert data from sever side to JSON formate
    to the client


## swagger in FastAPI
it's an virtual server because of this we don't need postman like React

## SQL Alchemy

## pymysql
it is a driver for MySQL.

## After this We need to configuration of database and FastAPI
1. Database connection
2. Write a Query
 --> Session - When we connect to database it's a session , a perticular time in that the
 interaction between developer and database.

# database url
db_url = "mysql://root:root@localhost:3306/fastapi"
 mysql -- type of database used
 root -- name of machine
 root -- password of machine
 localhost:3306 -- name of host system
 fastapi -- name of database
